            I am a software engineer currently living in Ireland. I grew up in France, where I developed a passion for programing at a young age.
            I started developing in Python on my own, and later started learning C and C++ when I joined {EPITECH.}, Paris. <br/>
            As a very curious person, I worked on a lot of school projects that exposed me to new technologies.
            These include, but are not limited to: android app development, REST API, SQL, blockchain, networking, game dev, embedded... <br/>
            I spent a year at DCU, Dublin, as part of Epitech's curriculum, where I perfected my English and learnt more about
            testing and testing philosophy, algorithm, and secure programming.
            There, I also unveiled a real passion for AI, specifically machine learning and prediction models.
            You can find one of my assignements on this subject below. <br/>
            I also have an interest in gaming, astronomy, and sciences in general.
